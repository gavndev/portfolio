I'm currently working on a **Social Music Sharing App** , which is a web app that tracks and shares music among users, allowing them to engage with playlists, likes, and comments. This project aims to combine front-end and back-end skills with a focus on UI/UX design. It'll be a while in the making, but I'm excited!!
